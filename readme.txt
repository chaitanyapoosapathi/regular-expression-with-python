# code can be found in main.py file written in python3.x
# writes out a text file(output.txt) with the score next to the file name
# reads case-insensitive words(volDemont=VoldeMont) 
# also reads any word that starts with "ki" and ends with "en"

Assumptions
# the challenge instructions didnt mention anything about reading phrases directly from high/low risk files, so i added those phrases into the code, the code would vary if it needs to read from a text file or so
# since we are looking for a specific set of phrases i didnt make a function(def) for this code, it would be more realistic to have a function when we have a list of risk-phrases as input
